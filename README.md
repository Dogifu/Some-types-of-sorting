Here's the explanation of the sorting algorithms in the provided code:

Bubble Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.
Merge Sort:

Recursive Version:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases.
Iterative Version:
Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases.
Quick Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n log n) in the average and best cases.
Insertion Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case.
Selection Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst, average, and best cases.
Heap Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n log n) in the worst, average, and best cases.
Shell Sort:

Time Complexity: In the worst case, it depends on the chosen gap sequence, typically O(n^2).
Gnome Sort:

Time Complexity: O(n^2) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case.
These algorithms represent different sorting methods with varying time complexities and characteristics. The user can choose the sorting method when running the program, and the program plots the growth of time complexity for the selected algorithm.
